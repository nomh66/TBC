              Synyster Gates when he was younger because he would show up to
              band practices and explain how their bassist sucked. There had
              been three bassists (Matt Wendt, Justin Sane and Dameon Ash)
              before Johnny joined the group. He was officially listed as a band

            <p class="centered1">Their Sound</p>
            <p class="centered2">
              Avenged Sevenfold are known for their diverse rock sound and
              dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. The band emerged
              with a metalcore sound on their debut album Sounding the Seventh
              Trumpet and largely continued this sound through their second
              album Waking the Fallen. However, the band's style had evolved by
              their third album and first major label release, City of Evil,
              into a more traditional heavy metal style. The band continued to
              explore new sounds with its self-titled release and enjoyed
              continued mainstream success before their founding drummer, Jimmy
              "The Rev" Sullivan, died in 2009. Despite his death, Avenged
              Sevenfold continued on with the help of ex-Dream Theater member
              Mike Portnoy, and released and toured in support of their fifth
              album Nightmare in 2010, which debuted atop the Billboard 200,
              their first number one debut.
