        <h3>Waking The Fallen</h3>
        <p>
          Waking the Fallen is the second studio album by American heavy metal
          band Avenged Sevenfold, released on August 26, 2003, through Hopeless

        <h3>City Of Evil</h3>
        <p>
          City of Evil is the third studio album by American heavy metal band
          Avenged Sevenfold, released on June 6, 2005, through Warner Bros. and
          Hopeless Records. Co-produced by Andrew Murdock, City of Evil contains
          a more traditional heavy metal and hard rock sound than Avenged
          Sevenfold's previous two albums, which showcased a predominantly
          metalcore sound. The album title is derived from a lyric in the song,
          "Beast and the Harlot". The album is notable for the absence of fry
          vocals. M. Shadows worked for months before the album's release with
          vocal coach Ron Anderson, whose clients have included Axl Rose and
          Chris Cornell, to achieve a sound that had "grit while still having
          the tone". In order to increase stamina and strength on the pedals,
          The Rev would sit for hours practicing until he could get up to 210
          beats per minute.

        <h3>Avenged Sevenfold</h3>
        <p>
          Avenged Sevenfold (also known as The White Album) is the fourth studio
          album by American heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released on
          October 30, 2007, through Warner Bros. and Hopeless Records. Recorded
          in the middle of 2007, it is the band's first studio album to be
          solely self-produced. It is also their final studio album to feature
          The Rev performing on drums before his death during production of
          their follow-up album, Nightmare (2010). Originally slated for an
          October 16 release, it was delayed by two weeks in order to provide
          more time to complete bonus material and production for the record.

          James", was written in his memory.

          Avenged Sevenfold. It was released on October 28, 2016, through

          Avenged Sevenfold album to feature drummer Brooks Wackerman, who
          joined the band in November 2015[3] but was not revealed as previous
          drummer Arin Ilejay's official replacement until Ilejay's departure in
          2015, because the band wanted to find a drummer that would "fit in".

        <h3>Life Is But A Dream...</h3>
        <p>
          Life Is But a Dream... is the eighth studio album by American heavy
          metal band Avenged Sevenfold, released on June 2, 2023, through Warner
          Records. Its release follows nearly seven years after its predecessor,
          The Stage (2016), marking the band's longest gap between studio albums
          to date. It is also the first album to feature contributions from
          their late drummer Jimmy "The Rev" Sullivan since Nightmare (2010).
          Similar to The Stage, Life Is But a Dream... was produced by the band
          with Joe Barresi. It marks the band's return to Warner following a
          legal dispute between the band and Warner Music in the mid-2010s.
